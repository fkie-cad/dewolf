    "longdescription": "# dewolf\n\ndewolf is a research decompiler we developed during a research cooperation from 2019 to 2021 between Germany (Fraunhofer FKIE) and Singapore (DSO National Laboratories).\n\nThe restructuring of dewolf is based on the former DREAM/DREAM++ approach [Yakdan et al. NDSS 2015, IEEE (SP) 2016].\n\nThe decompiler dewolf is implemented as a plugin for Binary Ninja and uses their Medium-Level intermediate language as the starting point.\nAlthough we consider dewolf to be pretty stable, it is still a research prototype and not extensively optimized for production use.\nConsequently, you will likely observe a few bugs or even decompilation failures when applying dewolf on real-world binaries.\n\n**If you encounter any bugs, please report them to us so that we can further improve dewolf. :)**\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter enabling the dewolf decompilation dock widget via **View > Other Docks > Show Dewolf**, the decompiled code for the currently active symbol will be displayed.\nIn the dewolf dock, it is possible to navigate through functions by double-clicking them.\n\n![Widget Menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12004321/145460440-be4b7dfd-bf7e-497f-a7af-1911bf3efc50.png)\n\nThe automatic decompilation of selected functions can be toggled with the *follow* button.\nDecompiled code is cached and can be generated again with the *decompile* button, e.g. after patching instructions in the binary view.\n\n![Widget](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12004321/145460476-f869e5cc-d585-4f53-8920-6ecfa4b346d5.png)\n\n## Configuration\ndewolf has multiple configuration options of which some are configurable via the GUI.\n\nYou can configure dewolf from the Binary Ninja GUI by navigating to **Edit > Preferences > Settings** or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>.\nSearch for **dewolf** in the search bar and all dewolf related settings will be displayed.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have any suggestions, or bug reports, please create an issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/fkie-cad/dewolf/issues).\n\nIn case you have any questions or other problems, feel free to send an email to:\n\n[dewolf@fkie.fraunhofer.de](mailto:dewolf@fkie.fraunhofer.de).",
